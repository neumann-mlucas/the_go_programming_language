# Exercise 5.8 (P134)

Modify `forEachNode` so that the `pre` and `post` functions
return a boolean result indicating whether to continue the traversal.
Use it to write a function `ElementByID` with the following signature
that finds the first HTML element with the specified `id` attribute.
The function should stop the traversal as soon as a match is found.

```golang
    func ElementByID(doc *html.Node, id string) *html.Node
```
