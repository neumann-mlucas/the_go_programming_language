# Exercise 9.4 (P280)

Construct a pipeline that connects an arbitrary number of goroutines with channels.
What is the maximum number of pipeline stages you can create with out running out of memory?
How long does a value take to transit the entire pipeline?

## Result

### With ResetTimer after initialize all channels
