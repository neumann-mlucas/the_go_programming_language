# Exercise 8.2 (P222)

Implement a concurrent `File Transfer Protocol (FTP)` server.
The server should interpret commands from each client such as `cd` to chagne directore,
`ls` to list a directory,
`get` to send the contents of a file,
and `close` to close the connection.
You can use the standard ftp command as the client, or write your own.
